At some point I could feel a pain all over my back, I stretched my back and I knew to stay with it until it disappeared. An intense experience, a pain connected to me and female generations before me, a shared pain. Now finding its moment to be released. I move more, fulfilling the need for yoga poses that I do not practice usually, and further marinating in the Kundalini energy. So pure, so loving.",

I cried all the way home because this has awakened my soul and I will forever be grateful. I will keep doing this practice because once you open up to your soul and energy, there's no turning back.
