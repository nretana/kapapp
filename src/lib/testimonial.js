        Movements initiated in the moment not by the mind.  At some point I could feel a pain all over my back, 
        I stretched my back and I knew to stay with it until it disappeared.  An intense experience, a pain 
        connected to me and female generations before me, a shared pain. Now finding its moment to be released. 
        I move more, fulfilling the need for yoga poses that I do not practice usually, and further marinating 
        in the Kundalini energy. So pure, so loving.`,

        following allowing the energy to flow and ebb, rise and fall, move and become stillness. I was entranced and entrained, moving 
        through emotions and their physicality with a power intensity that defied my logical mind... and so allowing another layer of 
        healing to express and another breath of consciousness to awaken. Life changing. Thank you Eugenia for your courage and integrity.`,

        of blocked energy some old grief released. Eugenia is a kind thorough facilitator and you feel safe respected in the

        I cried and let out all that doesn't serve me. I then recognized that I am more than my thoughts. I have been awakened 
        to this secret we have inside us. After my session with Eugenia, I have been really acknowledging what life is. I cried 
        all the way home because this has awakened my soul and I will forever be grateful. I will keep doing this practice because 
        once you open up to your soul and energy, there's no turning back. Eugenia I'm coming back!!! I want more!`,
